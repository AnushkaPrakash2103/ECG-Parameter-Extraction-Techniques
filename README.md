# **ECG Parameter Extraction using DWTAE an Classification**

**Overview**

This project implements ECG feature extraction using the Discrete Wavelet Transform Automated Extraction (DWTAE) algorithm and classifies signals with Support Vector Machine (SVM) in MATLAB. It efficiently detects key ECG parameters such as QRS complexes, P waves, and T waves, even in noisy environments, making it useful for cardiac diagnosis.

**Usage**
- Load the sample ECG signal in MATLAB.

- Apply the DWTAE algorithm to extract ECG features.

- Train the SVM model and classify ECG signals.

**Tech Stack**
- *Language*: MATLAB

- *Algorithm*: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

- *Machine Learning*: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Applications**
- Can be used for cardiac disease detection and health monitoring systems.

- Helps in feature extraction for ECG classification models.
