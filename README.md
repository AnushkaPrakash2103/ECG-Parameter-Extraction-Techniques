ECG Parameter Extraction using DWTAE

Overview
- This project implements ECG feature extraction using the Discrete Wavelet Transform Automated Extraction (DWTAE) algorithm in MATLAB. It efficiently detects key ECG parameters such as QRS complexes, P waves, and T waves, even in noisy environments, making it useful for cardiac diagnosis.

Usage
- Load the sample ECG signal in MATLAB.

- Apply the DWTAE algorithm to extract ECG features.

- View the extracted parameters using visualization scripts.

Tech Stack
- Language: MATLAB

- Algorithm: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

Applications
= Can be used for cardiac disease detection and health monitoring systems.

- Helps in feature extraction for ECG classification models.
